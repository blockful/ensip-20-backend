# External Resolver

## Overview

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has revolutionized the way we interact with the blockchain by replacing complex addresses with human-readable domain names like "myname.eth". However, ENS faces scalability and cost challenges that hinder its widespread adoption. The External Resolver project offers an innovative solution to overcome these obstacles by combining established patterns such as ERC-3668, EIP-5559, ENSIP-10, and ENSIP-16.

At its core, a "resolver" is a crucial component of ENS that translates human-readable domain names into relevant blockchain information, such as wallet addresses, public keys, and custom records. The "resolution" process is fundamental for making domain names usable in decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets.

The External Resolver takes the concept of resolution further by allowing ENS data to be stored and managed off-chain. This drastically reduces transaction costs, improves network scalability, and enables more advanced features like larger and more complex data records.

This project not only makes ENS more efficient and cost-effective but also opens up a world of possibilities for developers and users, expanding the potential of ENS as a foundational infrastructure for Web3. By providing a comprehensive reference implementation for off-chain storage and management, the External Resolver empowers the community to innovate and build upon the ENS ecosystem.

## Objectives

- **Enhance Scalability**: Improve ENS scalability for broader adoption.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Lower costs for ENS users.
- **Increase Usability**: Make ENS more user-friendly and accessible.
- **Reference implementation**: Create a reference on how to implement off-chain storage and management.

## Components

The External Resolver consists of three main components, each of them is a self-contained project with its own set of files and logic, ensuring seamless integration and collaboration between them. This modular architecture allows for flexibility and customization, making the External Resolver a versatile solution for various use cases.

### Gateway

The Gateway serves as the bridge between the blockchain and external data sources. It follows the EIP-3668 specification to fetch data from off-chain storage and relays it back to the client. The Gateway ensures secure and efficient communication between the different components of the system.

### Contracts

The smart contracts are the backbone of the External Resolver. They include the L1 Resolver, which redirects requests to external resolvers, the L2 Resolver Contract, which handles the actual resolution of domain names on Layer 2 networks and more. These contracts are designed to be modular and adaptable, allowing for deployment on various EVM-compatible chains.

#### Database Resolver

A smart contract that stores ENS domain data off-chain in a database. It enables cost-effective domain management by handling storage operations through the Gateway.

#### L1 Resolver

A smart contract that redirects requests to specified external contract deployed to any EVM compatible protocol.

#### L2 Resolver

An L2 contract capable of resolving ENS domains to corresponding addresses and fetching additional information fully compatible with the [ENS' Public Resolver](https://docs.ens.domains/resolvers/public) but responsible for authentication.

### Client

The client acts as the interface between the user and the Blockchain. It handles requests for domain resolution and interacts with the Gateway to retrieve the necessary information.

Sample interaction with the Database Resolver:

```ts
try {
    await client.simulateContract({
      functionName: 'register',
      abi: dbAbi,
      args: [toHex(name), 300],
      account: signer.address,
      address: resolverAddr,
    })
  } catch (err) {
    const data = getRevertErrorData(err)
    if (data?.errorName === 'OperationHandledOffchain') {
      const [domain, url, message] = data.args as [
        DomainData,
        string,
        MessageData,
      ]
      await handleDBStorage({ domain, url, message, signer })
    } else {
      console.error('writing failed: ', { err })
    }
}
```

Sample interaction with the Layer 1 Resolver:

```ts
const calldata = {
  functionName: 'setText',
  abi: l1Abi,
  args: [namehash(name), 'com.twitter', '@blockful'],
  address: resolverAddr,
}
try {
    await client.simulateContract(calldata)
  } catch (err) {
    const data = getRevertErrorData(err)
    if (data?.errorName === 'OperationHandledOnchain') {
      const [chainId, contractAddress] = data.args as [bigint, `0x${string}`]

      await handleL2Storage({
        chainId,
        l2Url: providerL2,
        args: {
          ...calldata,
          address: contractAddress,
          account: signer,
        },
      })
    } else if (data) {
      console.error('error setting text: ', data.errorName)
    } else {
      console.error('error setting text: ', { err })
    }
}
```

## Usage

To run the External Resolver project in its entirety, you'll need to complete the installation process. Since we provide an off-chain resolver solution, it's essential to set up both the database and the Arbitrum Layer 2 environment. This will enable you to run comprehensive end-to-end tests and verify the functionality of the entire project.

### Database Setup

1. Run a local PostgreSQL instance (no initial data is inserted):

    ```shell
    docker-compose up db -d
    ```

2. Deploy the contracts locally:

    ```bash
    npm run contracts dev:db
    ```

3. Start the gateway:

    ```bash
    npm run gateway dev:db
    ```

4. Write properties to a given domain:

    ```bash
    npm run client start:write:db
    ```

5. Request domain properties through the client:

    ```bash
    npm run client read
    ```

#### Migrations

This repository relies on migrations to manage the database schema. To create a new migration, run the following command:

```bash
npm run gateway migration:create --name=<migration_name>
```

To apply the migration, run the following command:

```bash
npm run migration:generate -- -n <migration_name>
```

### Layer 2 Setup

1. Deploy the contracts to the local Arbitrum node (follow the [Arbitrum's local node setup tutorial](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/run-local-dev-node)):

    ```bash
    npm run contracts dev:arb:l2
    ```

2. Gather the contract address from the terminal and add it [here](https://github.com/blockful-io/external-resolver/blob/main/packages/contracts/script/local/L1ArbitrumResolver.s.sol#L56) so the L1 domain gets resolved by the L2 contract you just deployed.

3. Start the gateway:

    ```bash
    npm run gateway dev:arb
    ```

4. Request domain properties through the client:

    ```bash
    npm run client start
    ```

### Layer 1 Setup

1. Run the local node:

    ```bash
    anvil
    ```

2. Deploy the contracts to the local node:

    ```bash
    npm run contracts dev:eth
    ```

3. Gather the contract address from the terminal and add it [here](https://github.com/blockful-io/external-resolver/blob/main/packages/contracts/script/local/L1ArbitrumResolver.s.sol#L56) so the L1 domain gets resolved by the L2 contract you just deployed.

4. Start the gateway:

    ```bash
    npm run gateway dev:eth
    ```

5. Request domain properties through the client:

    ```bash
    npm run client read
    ```
